# Analysis-of-How-Data-Experts-are-Compensated-in-Kenya-Phoenix-KE-Analytics-Survey
This project involves analyzing a dataset of 293 survey responses from professionals in Kenya's data field, focusing on their roles, tools, compensation, and benefits. 

### Key Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure accuracy and usability.
- Analyze compensation trends, tool usage, and sector representation.
- Provide recommendations to improve survey design and data collection processes.

### Key Findings 
- Compensation Insights: Data engineers reported the highest average salaries, while interns received the lowest. Men earned 10% more than women on average, highlighting a potential gender pay gap. Established companies paid 68% better than startups
- Tool Usage: Excel, SQL, Power BI and Python were the most commonly used tools.
- Sector Representation: The NGO sector had the highest compensation
- Survey Design: Ambiguities in the survey structure and phrasing limited the depth of some analyses, suggesting the need for clearer question design.

### Technical Highlights
- Utilized Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.
- Generated pivot tables and visualizations to uncover trends in tool usage, salary, and benefits.
- Designed a dynamic dashboard for interactive exploration of the dataset.

### Recommendations
- Introduce dropdowns for categorical inputs in future surveys to minimize inconsistencies.
- Improve phrasing around tool usage to distinguish between “main tech stack” and “daily tools.”
- Introduce a local or foreign company section
  
This project showcases practical data cleaning and analysis techniques while highlighting critical insights for Kenya’s data industry. It also demonstrates the importance of effective survey design in driving actionable insights.
